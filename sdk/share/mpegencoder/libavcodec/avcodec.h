 * Two decoders with the same ID can decode the same streams.
 * Two encoders with the same ID can encode compatible streams.

 * details.
 *
 * If you add a codec ID to this list, add it so that

 * 2. Give it a value which when taken as ASCII is recognized uniquely by a human as this specific codec.
 *    This ensures that 2 forks can independently add AVCodecIDs without producing conflicts.
